      "message": "parser: ignore empty environment variables\n\nTreat empty environment variables as \"not set\" to prevent template\nplaceholders (e.g., AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=\"\") from overwriting defaults.\n\nThis approach is debatable. If the community prefers empty strings to\noverride defaults, we can revert this and comment out empty variables in\nkustomization templates instead.\n\nThis might be the root cause of pods failing with timeout because empty\nenv vars cause cloud provider initialization to fail silently,\npreventing readiness probes from succeeding.\n\nSigned-off-by: Beraldo Leal <bleal@redhat.com>",

      "message": "parser: ignore empty environment variables\n\nTreat empty environment variables as \"not set\" to prevent template\nplaceholders (e.g., AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=\"\") from overwriting defaults.\n\nThis approach is debatable. If the community prefers empty strings to\noverride defaults, we can revert this and comment out empty variables in\nkustomization templates instead.\n\nThis might be the root cause of pods failing with timeout because empty\nenv vars cause cloud provider initialization to fail silently,\npreventing readiness probes from succeeding.\n\nSigned-off-by: Beraldo Leal <bleal@redhat.com>",

      "message": "parser: ignore empty environment variables\n\nTreat empty environment variables as \"not set\" to prevent template\nplaceholders (e.g., AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=\"\") from overwriting defaults.\n\nThis approach is debatable. If the community prefers empty strings to\noverride defaults, we can revert this and comment out empty variables in\nkustomization templates instead.\n\nThis might be the root cause of pods failing with timeout because empty\nenv vars cause cloud provider initialization to fail silently,\npreventing readiness probes from succeeding.\n\nSigned-off-by: Beraldo Leal <bleal@redhat.com>",
